# ðŸ“Š Employee Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes internal employee communications to assess overall sentiment, rank employee engagement, detect flight risk, and build predictive sentiment models using natural language processing and machine learning.

## ðŸ§© Tasks Overview

### âœ… Task 1: Sentiment Labeling
- Each message was labeled as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using TextBlob sentiment polarity.
- Labels were saved in `test_with_sentiment.csv`.

### âœ… Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored sentiment distribution, message volume, and message length.
- Visuals saved in the `visualizations/` folder.

### âœ… Task 3: Monthly Sentiment Score Calculation
- Assigned scores (+1, 0, -1) and calculated employee-wise **monthly sentiment scores**.
- Output stored in `monthly_sentiment_scores.csv`.

### âœ… Task 4: Employee Ranking
- Ranked top 3 most positive and most negative employees for each month.
- Stored in `employee_monthly_rankings.csv`.

### âœ… Task 5: Flight Risk Identification
- Employees with **4 or more negative messages in any rolling 30-day window** were flagged as flight risks.
- Output: `flight_risk_employees.csv`.

### âœ… Task 6: Predictive Modeling
- Built a **Linear Regression** model to predict sentiment scores using message-level features.
- Evaluated using **MAE** and **RÂ²**.
- Charts: `actual_vs_predicted.png`, `residual_plot.png`
